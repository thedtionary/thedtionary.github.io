<span class="bolded">Dicktionary </span>
 is a project inspired by countless experiences of verbal
harassment online and offline.
</p>
<p>
Its purpose is to show other
women, that these terms do not define them in a negative way. On the
contrary, they exemplify their strength, beauty, empathy, and
independence, which others have found difficult to come to terms with.
</p>
Dicktionary is a safe space in which you can  <Link to={'/form'} className="link"><span class="bolded" style = {{color:'#fee80c'}}> share your own story</span></Link> or
simply find strength in those of others.
